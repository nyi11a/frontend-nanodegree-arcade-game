# **Frogger: Ladybug Shuggle Edition**
========

Udacity provided visual assets and a game loop engine. With these tools,  object-oriented JavaScript was used to add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.


## **Playing Instructions**
--------
The Premise of the game is simple: cross the grass and stone streets to get to the water. If you can do this without crashing into a ladybug, then you get a point. If you don't, the game will restart. Once you successfully cross over 5 times, you win the game!
